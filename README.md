# Game Price Comparer

## Description

**Game Price Comparer** is a Python CLI application that allows users to search for a game or DLC and quickly find the lowest available price across multiple stores using an external API.

The application provides:
- The exact game or DLC title  
- The store offering the lowest price  
- The regular (average) price  
- A direct link to the store page  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Requests (API consumption)  
- JSON (data handling)  
- Pytest (unit testing)  

---

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Consuming and handling data from an external REST API  
- Working with endpoints and HTTP methods  
- Structuring a project using object-oriented programming (OOP)  
- Writing clean, modular, and testable Python code  
- Solving a real-world problem with a CLI-based solution

## Motivation

This project was built to solve a practical problem: manually searching multiple stores to find the best price for a game is time-consuming and inefficient.

By leveraging the **IsThereAnyDeal** public API, this tool automates the process and delivers clear and useful results through a simple command-line interface.
